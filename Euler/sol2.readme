Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

So with the Fibonacci sequence 1st we set up the variables, Iâ€™m using 4, f1 and f2 are used for the first two numbers in the sequence. The next two variables are temp which is used to temporarily store values that will eventually go into f2. Final is the variable that adds up all the values that were in the temp variable at each execution of the loop. So the while loop runs until 4 million is reached after that I put the value of f2 into temp and check if there is a remainder when divided by 2 we add the temp to final variable. So now we use the temp variable to store the sum of f1 and f2 which is the next sequence in Fibonacci and put the value of f2 in f1 and then the value from temp to f2 so now the new values are correct for the sequence to continue.
